        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These crunchy baguettes feature a chewy interior riddled 
            with holes, and a crisp, deep-golden crust. While it's 
            a challenge to make "real" baguettes at home, this 
            version is probably as close to an artisan bakery 
            version as you're going to find. The ingredients in 
            baguettes are pure simplicity: flour, water, salt, and 
            yeast. It's the baker's technique that turns an average 
            baguette into an all-star.</p>
