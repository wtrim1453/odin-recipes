        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These crunchy baguettes feature a chewy interior riddled 
            with holes, and a crisp, deep-golden crust. While it's 
            a challenge to make "real" baguettes at home, this 
            version is probably as close to an artisan bakery 
            version as you're going to find. The ingredients in 
            baguettes are pure simplicity: flour, water, salt, and 
            yeast. It's the baker's technique that turns an average 
            baguette into an all-star.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h4>Starter</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup water, cool</li>
            <li>1/16 teaspoon (a pinch) active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Dough</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The starter</li>
            <li>1 cup + 2 tablespoons water, lukewarm</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 1/2 all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons table salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning 
                it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. In a 
                large bowl, combine the starter ingredients.</li>
            <li>To make the starter: Mix everything together to make 
                a soft dough. Cover and let rest at room temperature 
                for about 14 hours; overnight works well. The 
                starter should have expanded and become bubbly.</li>
            <li>To make the dough: Mix and knead everything together 
                — by hand, mixer or bread machine set on the dough 
                cycle — to make a soft, somewhat smooth dough; it 
                should be cohesive, but the surface may still be a 
                bit rough. If you're using a stand mixer, knead for 
                about 4 minutes on medium-low speed (speed 2 on a 
                KitchenAid); the finished dough should stick a bit 
                at the bottom of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a lightly greased medium-sized 
                bowl, cover the bowl, and let the dough rest and 
                rise for 45 minutes. Gently deflate the dough and 
                fold its edges into the center, then turn it over 
                in the bowl before letting it rise for an additional 
                45 minutes, until it's noticeably puffy.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work 
                surface. Gently deflate it, and divide it into three 
                equal pieces.</li>
            <li>Round each piece of dough into a rough ball by 
                pulling the edges into the center. Cover with 
                greased plastic wrap, and let rest for 15 minutes; 
                or for up to 1 hour, if that works better with your 
                schedule.</li>
            <li>Working with one piece at a time, flatten the dough 
                slightly then fold it nearly (but not quite) in 
                half, sealing the edges with the heel of 
                your hand.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough around 180° and repeat: fold, then 
                flatten. Repeat this whole process again; the dough 
                should have started to elongate itself.</li>
            <li>With the seam side down, cup your fingers and gently 
                roll the dough into a 16" log. Your goal is a 15" 
                baguette, so 16" allows for the slight shrinkage 
                you'll see once you're done rolling. Taper each end 
                of the log slightly to create the baguette's typical 
                "pointy" end.</li>
            <li>Place the logs seam-side down onto a lightly greased 
                or parchment-lined sheet pan or pans; or into the 
                folds of a heavily floured cotton dish towel (or 
                couche). Cover them with lightly greased plastic 
                wrap, and allow the loaves to rise until they're 
                slightly puffy ("marshmallow-y" is the term we use in 
                our baking school). The loaves should certainly look 
                lighter and less dense than when you first shaped them, 
                but won't be anywhere near doubled in bulk. This should 
                take about 45 minutes to an hour at room temperature 
                (about 68°F).</li>
            <li>Towards the end of the rising time, preheat your 
                oven to 450°F with a cast iron pan on the floor of 
                the oven, or on the lowest rack. If you're using a 
                baking stone, place it on a middle rack. Start to 
                heat 1 1/2 cups water to boiling.</li>
            <li>If your baguettes have risen in a dish towel or 
                couche, gently roll them (seam-side up) onto a 
                transfer peel and then roll back over onto a piece 
                of parchment, seam-side down. If you don't have a 
                transfer peel, roll the baguettes onto a piece of 
                parchment (seam-side down) and then place the 
                parchment on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Using a baker's lame (a special curved blade) or a 
                very sharp knife held at about a 45° angle, make 
                three to five long lengthwise slashes in each 
                baguette.</li>
            <li>Load the baguettes into the oven. If you're baking 
                on a stone, use a baker's peel to transfer the 
                baguettes, parchment and all, onto the hot stone. 
                Carefully pour the boiling water into the cast iron 
                pan, and quickly shut the oven door. The billowing 
                steam created by the boiling water will help the 
                baguettes rise, and give them a lovely, shiny 
                crust.</li>
            <li>Bake the baguettes — on the pan, or on a stone — 
                for 24 to 28 minutes, or until they're a very deep 
                golden brown. Remove them from the oven and cool 
                them on a rack. Or, for the very crispiest 
                baguettes, turn off the oven, crack it open about 
                2", and allow the baguettes to cool completely in 
                the oven, until both baguettes and oven are at room 
                temperature.</li>
            <li>Storage information: Store any leftover baguettes in 
                a paper bag overnight; freeze for longer storage. 
                Thaw and reheat just before serving.</li>
