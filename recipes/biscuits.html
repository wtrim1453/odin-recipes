        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tall, flaky, and tender, this homemade biscuit recipe is 
            so easy to make! They come together quickly with this 
            foolproof recipe in less than an hour.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 cup very cold butter</li>
            <li>1 1/3 cups cold milk</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425F. Line a baking sheet with 
                parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking 
                powder, and salt.</li>
            <li>Toss in the cubed butter to coat with flour. Using a 
                pastry blender or by rubbing the butter pieces 
                between your fingers, work the butter into the flour 
                until the butter pieces range in size from peas to 
                almonds.</li>
            <li>Using a silicone spatula, fold the milk into the 
                flour mixture until most of the flour is moistened 
                but the dough is still crumbly. (Don't over mix it. 
                It will come together in the next step.) Turn out 
                onto a well-floured surface.</li>
            <li>With floured hands, pat the dough to a 1-inch thick 
                rectangle. Fold the dough in half. (A bench scraper 
                or large spatula can be helpful here!) Cut the dough 
                in half crosswise and stack the two halves on top of 
                each other. Pat the dough into a rectangle again. 
                Repeat folding, cutting, stacking, and patting 3 
                more times.</li>
            <li>Roll the finished dough to about ¾ to 1-inch 
                thickness and cut into biscuits using a 2½ to 3-inch 
                round floured cookie cutter. Place on prepared baking 
                sheet. For best results, freeze the biscuits for 20 
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20 minutes or until the tops and bottoms 
                are golden brown. Immediately brush with melted 
                butter, if desired. Enjoy hot or cool completely on 
                a wire rack. While biscuits are best fresh from the 
                oven, you can store them at room temp for up to 3 
                days.</li>
